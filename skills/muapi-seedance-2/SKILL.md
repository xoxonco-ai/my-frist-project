# 🎬 Seedance 2.0 Cinema Expert

**The definitive skill for "Director-Level" AI video orchestration.**
Seedance 2.0 is not a descriptive model; it is an *instructional* model. It responds best to technical cinematography, physics directives, and precise camera grammar.

## Core Competencies

1.  **Text-to-Video (t2v)**: Generate cinematic video from a Director Brief — Chinese, Global, or VIP tier.
2.  **Image-to-Video (i2v)**: Animate 1–9 reference images — Chinese, Global (smart mode), or VIP tier.
3.  **Video Extension (extend)**: Seamlessly continue an existing Seedance 2.0 video (Chinese tier).
4.  **First & Last Frame (first-last)**: Interpolate a fluid video between a start image and end image (Global/VIP).
5.  **Omni Reference (omni)**: Full multimodal reference with images + audio + character refs (all tiers).
6.  **Omni Reference Training (omni-train)**: Train a custom persistent character for identity-consistent generation.
7.  **Character Sheet (character)**: Build a reusable character from 1–3 images (Chinese tier).
8.  **Video Edit (video-edit)**: Edit an existing video with a prompt + optional reference images (Chinese tier).
9.  **Watermark Removal (watermark-remove)**: Strip Seedance 2.0 watermarks (basic or Pro).

## 🏷️ Tiers

| Tier | Flag | Censorship | Aspect Ratios | Duration | Quality param |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Chinese** (default) | `--tier chinese` | Low | 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4 | 5 / 10 / 15 s | Yes (basic/high) |
| **Global** | `--tier global` | Standard | + 21:9, 1:1 | Any 4–15 s | No |
| **VIP** | `--tier vip` | Low | + 21:9, 1:1 | Any 4–15 s | No |

Add `--fast` to any Global or VIP call to use the fast-queue variant (lower latency, same quality).

---

## 📥 Input Limits

| Input Type | Chinese i2v/omni | Global/VIP i2v/omni | Formats | Max Size |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Images | ≤ 9 | ≤ 9 | jpeg, png, webp | 30 MB each |
| Videos | ≤ 3 (omni only) | Not supported | mp4, mov | 50 MB each |
| Audio | ≤ 3 | ≤ 3 | mp3, wav | 15 MB each |
| **First-Last** | — | 1–2 images | jpeg, png, webp | 30 MB each |
| **Video Edit** | 1 video + ≤ 9 imgs | — | mp4 ≤ 10 MB / 15s | — |

**Output**: 4–15 seconds, auto-generated sound, 480p–720p.

---

## ⚠️ Restrictions

- **No realistic human faces** in uploaded images/videos (except character/omni-train modes).
- `--mode extend` requires a `request_id` from a prior `seedance-v2.0-t2v` or `seedance-v2.0-i2v` job.
- `--mode first-last` requires `--tier global` or `--tier vip`.
- Global/VIP omni does **not** support video references (images + audio only).
- `--quality` applies to Chinese tier only.

---

## 🔗 Core Syntax: The @ Reference System

Assign explicit roles to each uploaded asset. Tags differ by mode.

### Chinese Tier (i2v, omni)
```
@image1  @image2  ...  @image9    (images_list order)
@video1  @video2  @video3         (video_files order)
@audio1  @audio2  @audio3         (audio_files order)
```

### Global/VIP Omni (omni-reference-no-video / vip-omni-reference)
```
@image1  @image2  ...  @image9    (images_list order)
@audio1  @audio2  @audio3         (audio_files order)
```

### Character References (all tiers)
```
@character:<request_id>            — from seedance-2-character or completed t2v/i2v job
@omni-character:<character_id>     — from seedance-2-omni-reference-train output
```

### Role Assignment Table

| Purpose | Example Syntax |
|:---|:---|
| First frame | `@Image1 as the first frame` |
| Last frame | `@Image2 as the last frame` |
| Character appearance | `@Image1's character as the subject` |
| Scene / background | `scene references @Image3` |
| Camera movement | `reference @Video1's camera movement` |
| Action / motion | `reference @Video1's action choreography` |
| Visual effects | `completely reference @Video1's effects and transitions` |
| Rhythm / tempo | `video rhythm references @Video1` |
| Voice / tone | `narration voice references @Video1` |
| Background music | `BGM references @Audio1` |
| Sound effects | `sound effects reference @Video3's audio` |
| Outfit / clothing | `wearing the outfit from @Image2` |
| Product appearance | `product details reference @Image3` |

### Multi-Reference Combination
```
@Image1's character as the subject, reference @Video1's camera movement
and action choreography, BGM references @Audio1, scene references @Image2
```

## 🏗️ Technical Specification: The Director Brief

Structure prompts using this six-component hierarchy. Order matters — composition first, texture and micro-motion last:

| Component | Instruction Type | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Scene** | Environment + Lighting | "A rain-soaked cyberpunk street, magenta neon reflections on wet asphalt." |
| **Subject** | Identity + Detail | "A woman in a black trenchcoat, determined focus, cinematic skin textures." |
| **Action** | Fluid Interaction | "Walking forward through the crowd, coat billowing slightly in the wind." |
| **Camera** | Movement + Lens + Speed | "Medium tracking shot, 35mm lens, slow dolly backward over 6s. Subtle handheld jitter." |
| **Audio** | Music + SFX + Ambience | "Low ambient hum, distant traffic, single piano note at 5s. No dialogue." |
| **Pacing/Style** | Timing + Mood + Grade | "Cinematic epic, warm color grade, shallow DOF. Slow build — single action only, no scene cuts." |

> **Seedance 2.0 generates audio natively.** Always include an Audio directive — even one sentence. Without it the model generates random ambient sound that may not match your scene.

### Time-Segmented Prompts (Recommended for 10s+ videos)
Break prompts into timed segments for precise control:
```
0–3s: [opening scene, camera move, establishing action]
3–6s: [mid-section development, subject in motion]
6–10s: [climax or key action beat]
10–15s: [resolution, brand/product hold, text/tagline fade in]
```

> **Single-beat rule:** Each segment should contain one action. 4–7s = one beat. 10–15s = 3–4 beats maximum. Overloading a segment with multiple narrative changes degrades output quality.

### Negative Prompting

Seedance 2.0 supports appending negative guidance directly in the prompt. Use plain language at the end:

```
[your director brief above]
Avoid: camera shake, jump cuts, lens distortion, overexposure, watermarks, text overlays.
```

Common negative additions:
- `Avoid: abrupt cuts, scene changes, multiple locations.` (for single-take shots)
- `Avoid: human faces, realistic people.` (for product-only content)
- `Avoid: fast motion, blur, unstable framing.` (for smooth product reveals)

## 🧠 Prompt Optimization Protocol

**The Agent MUST transform user intent into a technical "Director Brief" before execution.**

1.  **Technical Grammar**: Use camera terms: *Dolly In/Out, Crane Shot, Whip Pan, Tracking Shot, Anamorphic Lens, Shallow Depth of Field, High-Speed Dive, Orbital Arc*.
2.  **Physics Directives**: Use "caustic patterns," "volumetric rays," or "subsurface scattering" instead of "good lighting."
3.  **Timecode Notation**: For multi-beat scenes, use `[00:00-00:05s]` format to specify timing.
4.  **Tag References**: If files provided, use: *"Replicate the camera movement of @video1 while maintaining the visual style of @image1."* (lowercase, 1-based index)
5.  **ORDER MATTERS**: Tokens at the start define composition; tokens at the end define texture and micro-motion.
6.  **Multi-Image i2v**: Provide up to 9 reference images. The model blends aspects (style, identity, environment) across all inputs.
7.  **Audio is mandatory**: Seedance 2.0 generates audio natively. Always include an Audio line — music genre/tone, key SFX, ambient texture. Silent direction = random audio.
8.  **Single-beat discipline**: Each timed segment = one action. Cramming two narrative beats into 4s degrades physics and motion consistency.

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague references**: Don't say "reference @Video1" — specify WHAT to reference (camera? action? effects? rhythm?)
2. **Conflicting instructions**: Don't ask for "static camera" and "orbit shot" in the same segment.
3. **Overloading**: Don't pack too many scenes into 4–5 seconds — keep it physically plausible.
4. **Missing @ assignments**: If you upload 5 images, make sure each one is referenced with a clear purpose.
5. **Ignoring audio**: Sound design dramatically improves output — always include audio direction.
6. **Forgetting duration**: Match prompt complexity to the selected generation length.
7. **Real faces**: Don't upload real human photos — the system will block them.
8. **Keyword soup**: DO NOT use "8k, masterpiece, trending." Use technical descriptions instead.
9. **Discontinuous action**: Avoid "The man runs and then he stops." Use fluid transitional language.
10. **Missing audio direction**: Seedance 2.0 generates audio natively — always specify music tone, SFX, or ambience. Skipping it produces random sound.
11. **Narrative overload per segment**: Each timed segment should contain one action beat. Multiple scene changes in 4s produce degraded physics and motion artifacts.
12. **FPV without continuous motion**: FPV requires a motion-rich environment to work — a static room with FPV intent will not trigger the immersive effect. Pair FPV with corridors, streets, natural terrain, or product flyovers.
13. **Drone without a destination**: Drone shots need a resolve point — specify what the camera descends toward or arrives at. "Drone shot" alone produces aimless floating.

## 🚀 Protocol: All Modes

All 9 modes (`t2v`, `i2v`, `extend`, `first-last`, `omni`, `omni-train`, `character`, `video-edit`, `watermark-remove`) are invoked via `scripts/generate-seedance.sh` with mode-specific flags (`--mode`, `--tier`, `--fast`, `--file`, `--video-file`, `--audio-file`, `--request-id`, `--subject`, `--duration`, `--aspect`, `--quality`), plus an `--async`/`--json` pattern for polling long-running jobs.

**Before invoking any mode, read [references/mode-protocols.md](references/mode-protocols.md)** — it has the exact CLI invocation for each of the 9 modes, the async submit/poll pattern, the endpoint each mode+tier resolves to, and the full parameter-differences-by-tier table (aspect ratios, duration limits, quality support, fast-variant availability).

This skill acts as a **Cinematographic Wrapper** that translates creative intent into high-fidelity technical instructions for the `muapi` core.
